# Shoot to kill (Formerly Final Cut)

Hi everyone!

This is the source code/source game for Shoot to Kill (Formerly presented as Final Cut)!

This game is a film-noire-eqsue game (phew that's a mouthful) that combines 8-bit artwork (made by yours truly) along with jazzy music (also made by yours truly) combined with film aspects! (Done by Veve)

#STORY TIME (BACKSTORY)

So we all made this game during a game jam called Feb Fatale! It was run by Dames Making Games, a Toronto non-profit organization that empowers women and game making. Here's the link down below for the showcase! Yeah progress to fame right?

We continued working on it after the game jam and it was great! We even got to show it off at Comics Vs. Games that's run by the Hand Eye Society in Toronto! Check that link out here:

Super exciting! Met the most wonderful people here and made lots of unforgettable memories! 

#BUT HERE IS WHERE THINGS GET SAD DARK AND DREARY

So, upon bringing up contracts, we lose full contact with Veve Jaffa oh no! We haven't talked to her since as she blocked us on all social media and such. Made me really upset and depressed. She was a mentor I looked up to! And it really sucked because we worked together too. Now, with that put aside I decided to put up the work we all have put into this to give back to the community and have people learn how to make awesome unique games! Veve (our teammate) kept working on it and chose to block us from the game's Twitter, from Facebook, etc and wouldn't respond to us. 
#We reiterate the fact that we do NOT support our work being used/sold!!! So please please PLEASE report anyone selling/using our stuff please!
